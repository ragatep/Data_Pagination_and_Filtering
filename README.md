Teamtreehouse - Project 2
Data Pagination and Filtering

Hello Internet.

I built this [web app] (https://ragatep.github.io/Data_Pagination_and_Filtering/) that demonstrates a web development technique known as "pagination" that enhances a web page's usability for a project from Teamtreehouse's Techdegree Full Stack Javascript Unit 2. More about pagination [here] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_cookbook/Pagination).

I have only used the concepts and techniques listed in the project instructions, but I have also copied from sample codes provided from topics covered in the courses from Unit 2 and Project Resources.
